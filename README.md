# ðŸ“˜ India Literacy Analysis (1991â€“2031)



This project analyzes **Indiaâ€™s literacy trends** using census data (1991, 2001, 2011) and forecasts literacy rates up to **2031** using **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Growth** models.

## 1. Basic Literacy Analysis
- **Overall Literacy Rate (1991â€“2011):** **58.16%**
- **India-wide Literacy Trend:**
  
| Year | Literacy Rate (%) |
|------|--------------------|
| 1991 | 45.20 |
| 2001 | 54.50 |
| 2011 | 63.05 |

ðŸ“ˆ **Finding:** From 1991 to 2011, literacy improved by nearly **18 percentage points**, reflecting steady progress.

---

## 2. Gender-wise Literacy Rate
- **Male Literacy Rate:** 65.94%  
- **Female Literacy Rate:** 49.86%  

### Literacy by Gender:
- Male: 1991 (55%) â†’ 2001 (63%) â†’ 2011 (70%)  
- Female: 1991 (35%) â†’ 2001 (45%) â†’ 2011 (56%)  

### Gender Gap:
- 1991: ~20 points  
- 2001: ~18 points  
- 2011: ~14 points  

ðŸ‘‰ **Gap is narrowing**, but still significant. Female literacy rose faster, reducing disparity.

---

## 3. State-wise Literacy Rates
### Top 2 States:
- 1991: Mizoram (82%), Daman & Diu (73%)  
- 2001: Kerala (80%), Mizoram (74%)  
- 2011: Kerala (84%), Goa (80%)  

### Bottom 2 States:
- 1991: Bihar (22%), Jharkhand (30%)  
- 2001: Bihar (37%), Jharkhand (44%)  
- 2011: Bihar (50%), Arunachal Pradesh (55%)  

ðŸ“Œ **Kerala consistently leads**, Bihar consistently lags, though all states improved.

---

## 4. Spatial Patterns
- Heatmaps show literacy growth across India.  
- **Kerala** remains the **highest**, **Bihar** the **lowest**.  
- Regional divides persist, but gaps are narrowing.

---

## 5. Educational Attainment
- Strong expansion in **primary â†’ higher education** (1991â€“2011).  
- Graduate population **nearly doubled** from 2001 to 2011.  
- Weakest area: **vocational/technical education**.

---

## 6. Drop-off Rates
- Retention improved massively across levels.  
- Biggest gains: **Higher Secondary (+38%)** & **Graduate (+36%)**.  
- Vocational education remains stagnant.

---

## 7. Age-wise Education
- India remains **youth-dominated** (0â€“44 age group).  
- Elderly population is slowly rising â†’ future **aging challenge**.  

---

## 8. Inequality & Gender Gap
- **Fastest Closing Gaps:** Kerala, Mizoram, Meghalaya.  
- **Slowest Closing Gaps:** Arunachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar.  
- Urban Indiaâ€™s female literacy (76%) > Rural male literacy (75%) in 2011.

---

## 9. Temporal Trends
- **Fastest Improving States (1991â€“2011):**
  - Bihar (+28%), Jharkhand (+26%), Karnataka (+22%).  
- High growth states were mostly **low-base states catching up**.

---

## 10. Urban vs Rural Divide
- **Urban literacy > Rural literacy** across all years.  
- 1991: Urban 65% vs Rural 56%  
- 2011: Urban 81% vs Rural 69%  
- Gap persisted (~12%), but rural literacy improved steadily.

---

## 11. Clustering States
- States form **clusters** of high, medium, low literacy.  
- Southern & Western states lead.  
- Bihar & Jharkhand remain **low-cluster outliers**.  

---

## 12. Forecasting Literacy (2021 & 2031)
- **Linear Regression:**  
  - 2021 â†’ 72.1%  
  - 2031 â†’ 81.0%  
- **Logistic Growth:**  
  - 2021 â†’ 70.3%  
  - 2031 â†’ 76.1%  

ðŸ“Š **Key Takeaway:**  
- Both models predict India will surpass **70% by 2021** and approach **75â€“80% by 2031**.  
- Logistic is more **realistic** (accounts for slowdown as literacy nears 100%).  
- **Policy implication:** Without accelerated reforms, literacy may **plateau below 100%**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
- Literacy has grown steadily, but **regional, gender, and rural-urban gaps persist**.  
- **Kerala leads, Bihar lags**, though gaps are narrowing.  
- Forecasts suggest India will approach **universal literacy**, but additional interventions are needed to close **last-mile gaps**.
