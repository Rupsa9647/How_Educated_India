# Plot gap between male and female literacy over the years.
Overall Increase:
Both male and female literacy rates steadily increased between 1991 and 2011.

Male Literacy Rate:

1991: ~55%

2001: ~63%

2011: ~70%

Female Literacy Rate:

üëâ The gender gap has narrowed over time but still remains significant.
Female literacy improved faster than male literacy, helping reduce the gender disparity in education, though men still had higher literacy rates across all three decades.

4. Plot heatmap / choropleth map of India showing literacy distribution.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# heatmap findings
Kerala is the leader in literacy.
Bihar is the laggard but improving steadily.
All states showed progress from 1991 ‚Üí 2011, with many states surpassing 70% literacy by 2011.
The regional divide persists, but the gap is shrinking.

5. Educational Attainment Levels
--------------------------------------------------------------

# Distribution of Education Levels:
From 1991 to 2011, India saw huge expansion in primary, middle, secondary, and higher education.

Graduate population nearly doubled in 10 years (2001 ‚Üí 2011).

Despite progress, vocational/technical pathways remain underdeveloped.

Education growth is broad-based but still bottom-heavy, with primary education dominating.



6. Drop-off Rates:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Compare numbers from ‚ÄúBelow Primary‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúPrimary‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúMiddle‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí ‚ÄúGraduate‚Äù.
Massive progress in education retention between 1991 and 2011, especially in primary, secondary, higher secondary, and graduation levels.

Primary retention exceeds 100% in 2001/2011 due to expanded literacy/enrollment drives.

Biggest gains: Higher secondary (+38% points) and graduate level (+36% points).

Weakest area: Vocational/technical education, which remains neglected.
7.Age-wise Education Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India‚Äôs population surged across all age groups between 1991 and 2011.

The 0‚Äì6 and 15‚Äì44 groups dominate, making India a youth-driven nation.

The elderly population is rising slowly, hinting at future aging challenges.

These trends highlight both opportunities (large workforce) and challenges (education, jobs, healthcare for a young and aging population).


8. Inequality & Gender Gap Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Male vs Female gap in literacy ‚Üí state-wise and year-wise.
Fastest Closing (Lowest Gap)

1991: Mizoram, Kerala

2001: Kerala, Mizoram

2011: Kerala, Meghalaya

‚ùå Slowest Closing (Highest Gap)

1991: Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh

2001: Madhya Pradesh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli

2011: Jammu & Kashmir, Bihar

9. Temporal Trends (1991 ‚Üí 2011)
-----------------------------------------------

Identify fastest improving states.
High growth in low-base states: Bihar and Jharkhand had lower starting literacy rates in 1991, so their large percentage improvements reflect catching up with the national trend.

Sustained improvement post-2000: All three states continued to improve between 2001‚Äì2011, with Bihar leading.

Top 3 Fastest Improving States (1991 ‚Üí 2011):

10. Urban vs Rural Divide (if Area column = Rural/Urban/Total)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Literacy comparison: Rural vs Urban.
üìä Rural vs Urban Literacy Summary (Year-wise)
   Year   Area  Total Literacy Rate  Male Literacy Rate  Female Literacy Rate
0  1991  Rural             0.565485            0.657496              0.465458
1  1991  Urban             0.649432            0.735483              0.556986
2  2001  Rural             0.597059            0.688387              0.499851
3  2001  Urban             0.761566            0.824967              0.693611
4  2011  Rural             0.686593            0.756418              0.615222

In 1991, urban literacy (64.9%) was ~9% higher than rural literacy (56.5%).

By 2011, the gap persisted but narrowed slightly (Urban: 81.1%, Rural: 68.7% ‚Üí ~12% difference).

Urban India shows higher female literacy (76.3%) than even rural male literacy (75.6%) in 2011 ‚Üí strong indicator of urban advantage.


11. Clustering States:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Literacy inequality between states is reducing, as many states moved upward in clusters.

Southern and Western states lead, while northern and eastern states lag in literacy.

Bihar and Jharkhand remain outliers, stuck in the Low cluster even by 2011.

Policy impact is visible ‚Äì states like Karnataka, Haryana, and Tripura show remarkable improvement into higher clusters.

12. Forecasting:
---------------------------------------------

# Apply linear regression and logistic growth to forecast India‚Äôs literacy in 2021, 2031.
Both models predict major improvement: India should cross 70% literacy by 2021, and approach 75‚Äì80% by 2031.

Linear vs Logistic: Linear is optimistic (~81%), Logistic is cautious (~76%).

Realistic long-term view: Logistic growth is more plausible since literacy cannot exceed 100% and progress naturally slows near saturation.

Policy implication: To reach universal literacy, India needs accelerated interventions ‚Äî otherwise growth will plateau around 75‚Äì80% by 2031.
